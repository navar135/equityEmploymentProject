# equityEmploymentProject
A capstone project conducted by team 45 in the DS$A bootcamp hosted by Correlation One 
The aim of our project was to demonstrate that web inaccessibility is hindering the revenue of e-commerce companies.
Our project analyses three large datasets: U.S Census Data, Bureau of Labor Statistics Data, and WebMillion Data
A pipeline was created for the WebMillion data which explores website accessibility of e-commerce sites and the most popular platforms
A pipeline was created for the  U.S Census Data to characterize the income of people with moderate to low vision
